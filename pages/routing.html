                  <h2>Fire Station Response Planning and Site Analysis with Python</h2>
                  <h3>Background</h3>
                  <p>The time it takes to respond to a fire incident is greatly impacted by proper planning and
knowledge of the site. Using geospatial technologies and concepts, situational awareness
can be improved upon and potentially provide faster response times. Two main factors in
providing a prompt and efficient response are: (1) The shortest route from the fire station to the
geocoded address; and (2) the closest fire hydrant to the incident. The python script in this
project identifies and outputs both the shortest route and closest hydrant to a html page to help
fire fighters better respond to an incident</p>
                  <h3>Abstract</h3>
                  <p>The City of Charleston GIS department currently creates map books that outline streets and
hydrant locations. These books are used in the field to locate an incident and also as a method
for determining which hydrant(s) are nearby. There is often little time to plan during timesensitive emergency responses and the process of finding the incident address and locating
a nearby hydrant may be inefficient. Without proper planning, there is a decreased level of
situational awareness and a possible loss of time due to routing complications. While in the
field, identifying and locating fire hydrants can be difficult and often times time consuming.
Ideally, once a dispatch system is notified of an incident, the closest station should be notified
and instantly provided with the fastest route and closest hydrant.</p>
                  <p>This project delivers the information to the fire station and personnel through a web
based medium. By using the web as the primary medium, fire stations and personnel can
quickly receive routing and hydrant information as well as utilize the service through a wide
variety of devices. Equipment carried along with the truck such as computer or mobile devices
equipped with GPS can tie into the routing and help firefighters quickly identify the nearest
hydrant. The shortest route and nearest route is also stored in a geodatabase that can then be
used in static map creation for additional uses.</p>
                  <p>To identify the nearest route, a travel time surface was first created from the street
speed limits. Next, a shortest path analysis is calculated between the provided incident address
and fire station input. To add the shortest path as a polyline feature, a raster to polyline process
was used and converted to KML for web mapping. The nearest hydrant to the incident was
found using a buffer analysis and sort method to find the closest hydrant within the buffer (hose
length). Finally, a search cursor was used to identify the name of the image associated with the
nearest hydrant. For the final product, python launches the site that outlines the fastest route
on a Google map along with the image of the closest hydrant.</p>
